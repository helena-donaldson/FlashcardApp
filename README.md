# Web Development Project 3 - Math Flashcards

The following is a React web application created as part of CodePath's Intermediate Web Development course.

It's main inspiration was Quizlet. The cards specifically test a user's knowledge of famous mathematicians through history.

Features:

* Ability to shuffle flash cards into a random order as a user proceeds through a set
* Ability for users to enter answers to check for accuracy 
* Ability to processe input to allow for "mostly correct" answers- so case differences do not matters, or addition of special characters
* Flash cards have special colors to illustrate difficulty (green for easy, yellow for medium-difficulty, and red for hard)

It utilizes the React library.
